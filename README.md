This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Project description

For the project I used next.js and scss.

The given API was not giving any responses so I copied exmple response and saved it as local json file.

There was an attempt to use redux to change price with counters/incrementers, but lack of time and documentation made it unsuccessful.

Overall this project could use some refactoring and better framework research (creating more compnents optimising client and server side rendering).
If I would make this project again with given limitations I would avoid using next.js. While these frameworks and technologies can be powerful, in my experience, they disrupted each other's core principles and felt like an anti-pattern.
